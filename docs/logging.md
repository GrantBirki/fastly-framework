# Fastly Logging ðŸ“„

## About

If you need to configure logging for your service and would like to use the shared "Fastly Logging Variables" please see the **Configuring Logging** section in the [terraform-reference](terraform-reference.md) document. Note: you can configure logging in a ton of different ways and the [terraform-reference](terraform-reference.md) document just shows a model using the `HTTP logging` Fastly method.

## Fastly to Insights

Another way to view data and metrics about your Fastly service is with the "Fastly to Insights" metrics aggregator.

See documentation [here](/code/logs/fastly-to-insights/README.md) for more details.
