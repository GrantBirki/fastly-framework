# fastly-framework ‚è∞

A Framework for Using Fastly with Terraform, Automation, and CICD

## About üí°

This project is an open source framework for creating a CICD pipeline with Terraform that builds Fastly services.

Benefits:

* Using Git as a version control system for all Fastly changes
* Eliminate code reuse through shared VCL files, Snippets, and Terraform configuration blocks
* Test your services through a CICD pipeline before deploying them
* Integrate with chatops for deployments (Example: Slack)
* Quickly create new services from templates with `make service` - Using Jinja and Python
* Adopt *Infrastructure as Code* methodologies with Terraform
* Create your own pipeline stages for robust testing, alerts, approval, and much more
